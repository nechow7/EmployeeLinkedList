# EmployeeLinkedList

Designed a system to keep track of employee data.  The system keeps track of an employee’s name, ID number and hourly pay rate in a class called Employee.  This data is stored in a file (user selectable) with the id number, hourly pay rate, and the employee’s full name (example):

17 5.25 Daniel Katz

18 6.75 John F. Jones

It will print payroll information from data in a different file.  The data is the employee’s id number and a number of hours that they worked (example):

17 40

18 20

18 20

It will print payroll information based on the hourly wage from the first file multiplied by the number of times an employee worked in the second file. 

Output:

*********Payroll Information********
Daniel Katz, $270
John F. Jones, $210
*********End payroll**************
